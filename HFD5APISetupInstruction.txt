Visual Studio 2010 Configuration:

========================================================================
Using Visual Studio 2010 with HDF5 Libraries Built with Visual Studio 2010
========================================================================

   1. Set up the path for external libraries and headers

      The path settings will need to be in the project property sheets 
      per project. Go to "Project" and select "Properties", find 
      "Configuration Properties", and then "VC++ Directories".
          
      1.1 If you are building on 64-bit Windows, find the "Platform" dropdown
          and select "x64".
              
      1.2 Add the header path to the "Include Directories" setting.
          
      1.3 Add the library path to the "Library Directories" setting.
          
      1.4 Select Linker->Input and beginning with the
          "Additional Dependencies" line, enter the library names. The
          external libraries should be listed first, followed by the HDF5
          library, and then optionally the HDF5 High Level, Fortran, or C++
          libraries. For example, to compile a C++ application, enter:

          szip.lib 
          zlib.lib 
          hdf5.lib 
          hdf5_cpp.lib
